# Bernoulli-Naive-Bayes-in-M-L
The Bernoulli Naive Bayes is one of the variations of the Naive Bayes algorithm in machine learning and it is very useful to use in a binary distribution where the output label may be present or absent.  The main advantage of this algorithm is that it only accepts features in the form of binary values such as:  True or False Spam or Ham Yes or No 0 or 1
